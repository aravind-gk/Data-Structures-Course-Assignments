In my original implementation of Question 3b, I observed that there were many links whose  were not converging at all.
Hence, in my modified implementation of Question 3b, I'm not waiting for all links to converge. I'm only waiting for top K links to converge. 
And in the corner case that not even K links are converging even after 20 iterations, I'm considering all the links irrespective of whether or not they converged, and I'm outputting the top K links among them.
